#secomd thought: this pipeline can get you a callable neutral region for each population
# and then use that to get the NH. 
#this actually created a bias -- each population used a different denominator.
# Maybe we should just use the callable.bed for all individuals and 
# standardize it for the whole process.

#third thought: I just tried the second thought
#it did not yeild eonugh 1kb sets for the analysis
# so maybe... costumize the calculation and make them all 
# specific down to individuals?


#cut out the 1kb regions from the semi-neutral region ikb.py:no 25kb interval. They are 1kb side by side.
#auto_neutral_chunk.bed: the resultent neutral region bed file from the Neutral_Region_script

python3 ikb.py auto_neutral_chunk.bed auto_1kb.bed


#use the general ikb set and 
#intersect with population wise callable bed 
#to see how many bases are callable in the neutral 1kb regions. 
#The python script "half.callable.py" filters out the region 
#that are uncallable for over 50% of it. Or other proportions.
