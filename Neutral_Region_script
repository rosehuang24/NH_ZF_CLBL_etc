#might not be correct. I reran it today and the flow is https://github.com/rosehuang24/NH_ZF_CLBL_etc/G-PHOCS_freeman_NH.md

#this workflow was created in the ./freeman_nh folder
#the result file (auto_neutral_chunk.bed) was further deposited in the txt_might_be_useful folder under /wgsdata

#get the part that I don't want (phastscore >0.7) 
#the scores.bed file was from Xiaoyi

grep '^chr' /pdiskdata/zhenyinggroupADS/huangruoshi/wgsdata/neutral_region/scores.bed | sed 's/M/MT/g' | awk '$4 >= 0.7 {print$1"\t"$2"\t"$3}' > PClargerthan0.7.bed
bedtools merge -i PClargerthan0.7.bed | awk '$3-$2>49 {print$0}' > PC_dump.bed. #this is the freeman way.

#Conserved regions of the mouse genome were defined as stretches of consecutive bases with
#phastCons scores > 0.7 longer than 50 bp. The 50 bp threshold was chosen because this
#approximates the lower size limit of miRNA genes (www.mirbase.org), and such genes have
#been previously discovered within HARs 


#this part generate the bed file with regions I don't want:

cat PC_dump.bed editcds.bed | grep -v 'A' | grep -v 'K' | grep -v 'Z' | grep -v 'W' | grep -v 'M' |sed 's/chr//g' | sort -k1,1n -k2,2n -k3,3n  > after_cat.bed
bedtools merge -i after_cat.bed > dispose.bed

#replace those regions with N, so they got disposed together with missing positions in reference genome.

#the biopython no longer support IUPAC stuff, this script now just go trash.
